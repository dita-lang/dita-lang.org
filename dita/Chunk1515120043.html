 <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title3">The topic as the basic unit of information</h3>
 
 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph">In DITA, a topic is the basic unit of authoring
          and reuse. All DITA topics have the same basic structure: a title and, optionally, a body
          of content. Topics can be generic or more specialized; specialized topics represent more
          specific information types or semantic roles, for example,
            <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;concept&gt;</code>, <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;task&gt;</code>, or
            <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;reference&gt;</code></span></p>
  <p class="p">DITA topics consist of content units that can be as generic as sets of paragraphs and unordered
   lists or as specific as sets of instructional steps in a procedure or cautions to be considered
   before a procedure is performed. Content units in DITA are expressed using XML elements and can
   be conditionally processed using metadata attributes.</p>
  <p class="p">Classically, a DITA topic is a titled unit of information that can be understood in isolation
   and used in multiple contexts. It is short enough to address a single subject or answer a single
   question but long enough to make sense on its own and be authored as a self-contained unit.
   However, DITA topics also can be less self-contained units of information, such as topics that
   contain only titles and short descriptions and serve primarily to organize subtopics or links or
   topics that are designed to be nested for the purposes of information management, authoring
   convenience, or interchange.</p>
  <p class="p">DITA topics are used by reference from DITA maps. DITA maps enable topics to be organized in a
   hierarchy for publication. Large units of content, such as complex reference documents or book
   chapters, are created by nesting topic references in a DITA map. The same set of DITA topics can
   be used in any number of maps.</p>
  <p class="p">DITA topics also can be used and published individually; for example, one can represent an
   entire deliverable as a single DITA document that consists of a root topic and nested topics.
   This strategy can accommodate the migration of legacy content that is not topic-oriented; it also
   can accommodate information that is not meaningful outside the context of a parent topic.
   However, the power of DITA is most fully realized by storing each DITA topic in a separate XML
   document and using DITA maps to organize how topics are combined for delivery. This enables a
   clear separation between how topics are authored and stored and how topics are organized for
   delivery.</p>

<h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title4">The benefits of a topic-based architecture</h3>

   
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Topics enable the development of usable and reusable content.</p>
<p class="p">While DITA does not require the use of any particular
writing practice, the DITA    architecture is designed to support
authoring, managing, and processing of content that is    designed
to be reused. Although DITA provides significant value even when reuse
is not a primary    requirement, the full value of DITA is realized
when content is authored with reuse in mind. To    develop topic-based
information means creating units of standalone information that are
   meaningful with little or no surrounding context.</p>
<p class="p">By organizing content into topics that are written
to be reusable, authors can    achieve several goals: </p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Content is readable when accessed from an index or search, not
just when read in sequence as     part of an extended narrative. Since
most readers do not read technical and business-related     information
from beginning to end, topic-oriented information design ensures that
each unit of     information can be read independently. </li>
<li class="li">Content can be organized differently for online and print delivery.
Authors can create task     flows and concept hierarchies for online
delivery and create a print-oriented hierarchy to     support a narrative
content flow. </li>
         
<li class="li">Content can be reused in different collections. Since a topic is written to support random
            access (as by search), it should be understandable when included as part of various
            product deliverables. Topics permit authors to refactor information as needed, including
            only the topics that apply to each unique scenario. </li>
<li class="li">Content is more manageable in topic form whether managed
as     individual files in a traditional file system or as objects
in a content management system.</li>
<li class="li">Content authored in topics can be translated and updated
more efficiently and     less expensively than information authored
in larger or more sequential units.</li>
<li class="li">Content authored in topics can be filtered more efficiently,
encouraging the     assembly and deployment of information subsets
from shared information repositories. </li>
</ul>
      
<p class="p">Topics written for reuse should be small enough to
provide opportunities for reuse    but large enough to be coherently
authored and read. When each topic is written to address a single
subject, authors can organize a set of topics logically and achieve
an acceptable narrative content flow.</p>

                            <dd class="dd">A well-designed topic is reusable in other contexts to the extent
                                   that it is context free, meaning that it can be inserted into a
                                   new document without revision of its content. A context-free
                                   topic avoids transitional text. Phrases like "As we considered

                                   <p class="p">Most print publications or web pages are a mixture of content
                                          and navigation. Internal links lead a reader through a
                                          sequence of choices as he or she navigates through a
                                          website. DITA supports the separation of navigation from
                                          content by assembling independent topics into DITA maps.
                                          Nonetheless, writers might want to provide links within a
                                          topic to additional topics or external resources. DITA
                                          does not prohibit such linking within individual topics.
                                          The DITA relationship table enables links between topics
                                          and to external content. Since it is defined in the DITA
                                          map, it is managed independently of the topic content.</p>
                                   <p class="p">Links in the content are best used for cross-references within
                                          a topic. Links from within a topic to additional topics or
                                          external resources are best avoided because they limit reuse of the topic. To link from a term or keyword
                                          to its definition, use the DITA keyref facility to avoid
                                          creating topic-to-topic dependencies that are difficult to
                                          maintain. See <a class="xref" href="Chunk453856411.html#key-based_addressing" title="DITA keys provide an alternative to direct addressing.

    <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title6">Information typing</h3>
    
    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph">Information typing is the practice
          of identifying types of topics, such as concept, reference, and task, to clearly
          distinguish between different types of information. Topics that answer different reader
          questions (How do I? What is?) can be categorized with different information types. The
          base information types provided by DITA specializations (for example, technical content,
          machine industry, and learning and training) provide starter sets of information types
          that can be adopted immediately by many technical and business-related
        organizations.</span></p>
        <p class="p">Information typing has a long history of use in the technical documentation field to
            improve information quality. It is based on extensive research and experience, including
            Robert Horn's Information Mapping and Hughes Aircraft's STOP (Sequential Thematic
            Organization of Proposals) technique. Note that many DITA topic types are not
            necessarily closely connected with traditional Information Mapping.</p>
        <div class="p">Information typing is a practice designed to keep documentation focused and modular, thus
            making it clearer to readers, easier to search and navigate, and more suitable for
            reuse. Classifying information by type helps authors perform the following tasks:<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Develop new information more consistently </li>
                <li class="li">Ensure that the correct structure is used for closely related kinds of
                    information (retrieval-oriented structures like tables for reference information
                    and simple sequences of steps for task information) </li>
                <li class="li">Avoid mixing content types, thereby losing reader focus</li>
                <li class="li">Separate supporting concept and reference information from tasks, so that users
                    can read the supporting information if needed and ignore if it is not
                    needed</li>
                <li class="li">Eliminate unimportant or redundant detail</li>
                <li class="li">Identify common and reusable subject matter</li>
            </ul></div>
        <p class="p">DITA currently defines a small set of well-established information types that reflects
            common practices in certain business domains, for example, technical communication and
            instruction and assessment. However, the set of possible information types is unbounded.
            Through the mechanism of specialization, new information types can be defined as
            specializations of the base topic type (<code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;topic&gt;</code>) or as
            refinements of existing topics types, for example, <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;concept&gt;</code>,
                <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;task&gt;</code>, <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;reference&gt;</code>, or
                <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;learningContent&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p class="p">You need not use any of the currently-defined information types. However, where a
            currently-defined information type matches the information type of your content, use the
            currently-defined information type, either directly, or as a base for specialization.
            For example, for information that is procedural in nature, use the task information type
            or a specialization of task. Consistent use of established information types helps
            ensure smooth interchange and interoperability of DITA content.</p>

            Alternatively, the abstract lets you create more complex introductory content and uses
            an embedded short description element to define the part of the abstract that is
            suitable for summaries and link previews.</dd>

          <dt class="dt dlterm">Related links</dt>
          <dd class="dd">Related links connect to other topics. When an author creates a link as part of a
            topic, the topic becomes dependent on the other topic being available. To reduce
            dependencies between topics and thereby increase the ability to reuse each topic,
            authors can use DITA maps to define and manage links between topics, instead of
            embedding links directly in each related topic.</dd>
        
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">Nested topics</dt>
          <dd class="dd">Topics can be defined inside other topics. However, nesting requires special care
            because it can result in complex documents that are less usable and less reusable.
            Nesting might be appropriate for information that is first converted from desktop
            publishing or word processing files or for topics that are unusable independent from
            their parent or sibling topics.</dd>
          <dd class="dd ddexpand">The rules for topic nesting can be configured in a document-type shells. For example,
            the standard DITA configuration for concept topics only allows nested concept topics.
            However, local configuration of the concept topic type could allow other topic types to
            nest or disallow topic nesting entirely. In addition, the <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@chunk</code>
            attribute enables topics to be equally re-usable regardless of whether they are separate
            or nested. The standard DITA configuration for ditabase document-type documents allows
            unrestricted topic nesting and can be used for holding sets of otherwise unrelated
            topics that hold re-usable content. It can also be used to convert DITA topics from
            non-DITA legacy source without first determining how individual topics should be

          description/abstract. The topic body can be constrained to remove specific elements from
          the content model; it also can be specialized to add additional specialized elements to
          the content model. The topic body can be generic while the topic title and prolog are
          specialized.</dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Sections and examples</dt>
<dd class="dd">The body of a topic might contain divisions, such as sections and examples. They might contain
          block-level elements like titles and paragraphs and phrase-level elements like API names
          or text. It is recommend that sections have titles, whether they are entered directly into
          the <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;title&gt;</code> element or rendered using a fixed or default title.</dd>
<dd class="dd ddexpand">Either body divisions or untitled sections or examples can be used to delimit arbitrary
          structures within a topic body. However, body divisions can nest, but sections and
          examples cannot contain sections. </dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm"><code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;bodydiv&gt;</code></dt>
<dd class="dd">The <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;bodydiv&gt;</code> element enables the arbitrary grouping of content within
          the body of a topic for the purpose of content reuse. The <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;bodydiv&gt;</code>
          element does not include a title. For content that requires a title, use
            <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;section&gt;</code> or <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;example&gt;</code>.</dd>
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm"><code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;div&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd class="dd">The <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;div&gt;</code> element enables the arbitrary grouping of content
          within a topic. The <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;div&gt;</code> element does not include a title. For
          content that requires a title, use <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;section&gt;</code> or
            <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;example&gt;</code> or, possibly, <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;fig&gt;</code>. </dd>
      

<dt class="dt dlterm">Block-level elements</dt>
<dd class="dd">Paragraphs, lists, figures, and tables are types of "block" elements. As a class of content,
          they can contain other blocks, phrases, or text, though the rules vary for each
          structure.</dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Phrases and keywords</dt>
<dd class="dd">Phrase level elements can contain markup to label parts of a paragraph or parts of a sentence as
          having special semantic meaning or presentation characteristics, such as
            <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;uicontrol&gt;</code> or <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;b&gt;</code>. Phrases can usually
          contain other phrases and keywords as well as text. Keywords can only contain text.</dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Images</dt>
<dd class="dd">Images can be inserted to display photographs, illustrations, screen captures, diagrams, and
          more. At the phrase level, they can display trademark characters, icons, toolbar buttons,
          and so forth.</dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Multimedia</dt>
<dd class="dd">The <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;object&gt;</code> element enables authors to include multimedia, such as
          diagrams that can be rotated and expanded. The <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;foreign&gt;</code> element
          enables authors to include media within topic content, for example, SVG graphics, MathML
          equations, and so on.</dd>
