                                   and contains only the information needed to complete that task or
                                   grasp a fact. <span></span>Recipes, encyclopedia entries, car repair
                                   procedures; all serve up a uniquely focused unit of information.
<span></span>                                   The topic contains everything required by the reader.</dd>

                            <dd class="dd"><span></span>A well-designed topic is reusable in other contexts to the extent
                                   that it is context free, meaning that it can be inserted into a
                                   new document without revision of its content. <span></span>A context-free
                                   topic avoids transitional text. <span></span>Phrases like "As we considered
                                   earlier" or "Now that you have completed the initial step" make little sense if a topic is reused in a new context in
                                   which the relationships are different or no longer exist. <span></span>A
                                   well-designed topic reads appropriately in any new context
                                   because the text does not refer the reader outside the
                                   topic.</dd>

                                   <p class="p"><span></span>Most print publications or web pages are a mixture of content
                                          and navigation. <span></span>Internal links lead a reader through a
                                          sequence of choices as he or she navigates through a
                                          website. <span></span>DITA supports the separation of navigation from
                                          content by assembling independent topics into DITA maps.
<span></span>                                          Nonetheless, writers might want to provide links within a
                                          topic to additional topics or external resources. <span></span>DITA
                                          does not prohibit such linking within individual topics.
<span></span>                                          The DITA relationship table enables links between topics
                                          and to external content. <span></span>Since it is defined in the DITA
                                          map, it is managed independently of the topic content.</p>
                                   <p class="p"><span></span>Links in the content are best used for cross-references within
                                          a topic. <span></span>Links from within a topic to additional topics or
                                          external resources are best avoided because they limit reuse of the topic. <span></span>To link from a term or keyword
                                          to its definition, use the DITA keyref facility to avoid
                                          creating topic-to-topic dependencies that are difficult to
                                          maintain. <span></span>See <a class="xref" href="key-based-addressing.html" title="DITA keys provide an alternative to direct addressing. The key reference mechanism provides a layer of indirection so that resources (for example, URIs, metadata, or variable text strings) can be defined at the DITA map level instead of locally in each topic.">Key-based addressing</a></p>
