          <p class="p"><span></span>Vocabulary modules that are intended for use outside of a
            narrowly-restricted context should have one or more associated,
            globally-unique names by which the modules can be referenced
            without regard to their local storage location. <span></span>The
            globally-unique names can be public identifiers, URNs, or
            absolute URLs.</p>

          <p class="p"><span></span><span style="color:red;" class="ph">Document-type</span> shells should be given a
            name that distinguishes their name, owner, or purpose, for
            example, <span class="ph filepath">acme-concept.dtd</span>. <span></span>The <span style="color:red;" class="ph">document-type</span> shells that are provided by
            the DITA Technical Committee typically use the root element of
            the primary specialization as the basis for the file name. <span></span>If
            necessary, a qualifier such as <span class="keyword">base</span> is
            prepended to the name of the root element.</p>

          <p class="p"><span></span>For structural modules, the module name should be the element
            type name of the top-level topic or map type that is defined by
            the module, such as "topic" or "map".</p>
          <p class="p"><span></span>For element- or attribute-domain modules, the module name
            should be a name that reflects the subject domain to which the
            domain applies, such as "highlight" or "software". <span></span>Domain
            module names should be sufficiently unique that they are
            unlikely to conflict with any other domains.</p>
          <p class="p"><span></span>In addition, each element- or attribute-domain module has a
            short name that is used to construct entity names that are used
            in associated declarations. <span></span>Modules can also have abbreviated
            names that further shorten the short name, for example "hi-d"
            for the "highlight" domain, where "highlight" is the short name
            and "hi-d" is the abbreviated name. <span></span></p>
