  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span></span>LwDITA shares some core capabilities for content structure and reuse with DITA. <span></span>By
    design, it includes fewer capabilities than full DITA XML. <span></span>LwDITA also includes some unique
    cross-format features.</p>
    <p class="p"><span></span>LwDITA features the following capabilities:</p>
    <dl class="dl">
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">Modular content</dt>
        <dd class="dd"><span></span><p class="p"><span></span>While LwDITA does not require the use of any particular writing practice, its modular approach to
            content supports a variety of best practices for creating both usable and reusable
            content. <span></span>In LwDITA, each module is called a <a class="xref" href="../components/lw-topic.html" title="A topic is a standalone unit of information.">topic</a>, which can be
          published directly or collected and organized for publication by a <a class="xref" href="../components/lw-map.html" title="A DITA map is the mechanism for aggregating topic references and defining a context for those references. It contains references to topics, maps, and other resources.">map</a>.
<span></span>          LwDITA topics can be authored and managed as XML (<a class="xref" href="../authoring-formats/xdita/xdita-introduction.html" title="XDITA is the authoring format of LwDITA that uses XML to structure information. XDITA is a subset of DITA, with new multimedia element types added to support interoperability with HTML5.">XDITA</a>), HTML (<a class="xref" href="../authoring-formats/hdita/hdita-introduction.html" title="HDITA is the authoring format of LwDITA that uses HTML5 to structure information. It also uses custom data attributes to provide interoperability with DITA.">HDITA</a>), and Markdown
          (<a class="xref" href="../authoring-formats/mdita/mdita-introduction.html" title="MDITA is the authoring format of LwDITA that uses Markdown to structure information.">MDITA</a>) files as appropriate for diverse authoring communities and tool ecosystems. <span></span></p></dd>
      
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">Content collection and organization</dt>
        <dd class="dd"><span></span><p class="p"><span></span>In LwDITA, the document type of <a class="xref" href="../components/lw-map.html" title="A DITA map is the mechanism for aggregating topic references and defining a context for those references. It contains references to topics, maps, and other resources.">map</a>
            functions as a content collection and organization mechanism, which can be used to
            manage the linking, navigation and metadata for a group of topics. <span></span>LwDITA maps can be
            created in the <a class="xref" href="../authoring-formats/xdita/xdita-introduction.html" title="XDITA is the authoring format of LwDITA that uses XML to structure information. XDITA is a subset of DITA, with new multimedia element types added to support interoperability with HTML5.">XDITA</a>, <a class="xref" href="../authoring-formats/hdita/hdita-introduction.html" title="HDITA is the authoring format of LwDITA that uses HTML5 to structure information. It also uses custom data attributes to provide interoperability with DITA.">HDITA</a>, and <a class="xref" href="../authoring-formats/mdita/mdita-introduction.html" title="MDITA is the authoring format of LwDITA that uses Markdown to structure information.">MDITA</a> authoring formats, and they allow for cross-format collection and
            organization. <span></span>For example, a map authored in XDITA can collect and organize topics
            created in any combination of LwDITA formats. <span></span>The same can be accomplished with maps
            authored in HDITA and MDITA. <span></span></p></dd>
      
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">Linking</dt>
        <dd class="dd"><span></span><p class="p"><span></span>A LwDITA topic can link to another topic (or location in a topic) using the <a class="xref" href="../components/lw-xref.html" title="A cross reference is an inline link. A cross reference can link to a different location within the current topic, another topic, a specific location in another topic, or an external resource such as a PDF or web page.">cross-reference</a> component. <span></span>Links work across any of the LwDITA authoring formats. <span></span> </p></dd>
      
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">Filtering</dt>
        <dd class="dd"><span></span><p class="p"><span></span>LwDITA supports <a class="xref" href="../attributes/lwdita-attributes.html" title="This topic lists the XDITA attributes and their equivalents in HDITA and MDITA.">metadata-based filtering (link to props topic)</a> within a topic to selectively
            include or exclude content for specific contexts. <span></span> </p></dd>
      
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">Content references for reuse</dt>
        <dd class="dd"><span></span><p class="p"><span></span>In LwDITA, content can be reused across topics or maps using the <a class="xref" href="../attributes/lwdita-attributes.html" title="This topic lists the XDITA attributes and their equivalents in HDITA and MDITA.">content reference (link to
          conref!)</a> mechanism to pull block-level content, such as a paragraph or list item, from
            one location to another. <span></span>This reuse by reference ensures that content will stay
            consistent and up to date across all the contexts in which it is reused. <span></span>Content
            references work across any of the LwDITA authoring formats.</p></dd>
      
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">Variable management</dt>
        <dd class="dd"><span></span><p class="p"><span></span>In LwDITA, inline (variable) content can be defined in maps and reused in topics via the key
            reference mechanism (link to keyref). <span></span>This reuse by reference ensures that variable
            content will stay consistent and up to date across all the contexts in which it is
            reused. <span></span>Key references work across any of the LwDITA authoring formats.</p></dd>
      
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">Link redirection</dt>
        <dd class="dd"><span></span>
          <p class="p"><span></span>LwDITA supports link redirection via the key reference (link to keyref) mechanism. <span></span>A
            cross reference (link to xref) component can be combined with a key reference so authors
            can redirect links to a common topic. <span></span>Link redirection works across any of the LwDITA
            authoring formats.</p>
        </dd>
      
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">Specialization</dt>
        <dd class="dd"><span></span>
          <p class="p"><span></span>LwDITA follows the same specialization architecture as DITA, although there are some
            limitations. <span></span>Because LwDITA spans multiple authoring formats, coordination of the same
            specialization rules across markup languages poses some unique challenges. <span></span>Not all
            LwDITA formats will support specialization to the same degree. <span></span>For example, XDITA, the
            LwDITA authoring format based on XML, defines a default class attribute value for each
            component. <span></span>This class attribute can be used as basis for specialization. <span></span>In HDITA and
            MDITA—the LwDITA authoring formats based on HTML5 and Markdown, respectively—, there is
            no  mechanism for specialization (link to topic). <span></span></p></dd>
