                    One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace
                    requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while
                    another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include
                    a particular option must be prepared to interoperate with another implementation
                    which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
                    same vein an implementation which does include a particular option must be
                    prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the
                    option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides).</dd>
