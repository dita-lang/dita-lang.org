  <div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The DITA learning and training specializations apply DITA
	 principles and best practices for using topic-based and modular content to
	 plan, develop, and deliver learning and training content.

		<p class="p">The reusable learning objects, or RLO, approach to learning content
		  derives from the pioneering work of learning content designers at several
		  companies, including Autodesk®, Oracle®, and Cisco®. Author Peder Jacobsen
		  defines an RLO as "a discrete reusable collection of content used to present
		  and support a single learning objective." With this approach, it is possible to
		  gather a pool of information objects and make them available for reuse and
		  repurposing in a variety of learning delivery contexts.
		</p>
		<p class="p">There is a strong affinity between the DITA topic-based, modular
		  approach to content in general, and the learning objects approach to learning
		  content in particular.
		</p>
		<div class="p">Working assumptions about learning content and how to support
		  authoring and delivering it with DITA include the following:
