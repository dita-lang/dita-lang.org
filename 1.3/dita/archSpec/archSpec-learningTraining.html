While DITA historically has been driven by         the requirements of large-scale technical documentation authoring, management, and delivery,         it is a standard that is applicable to any kind of publication or information that might be         presented to readers, including interactive training and educational materials, standards,         reports, business documents, trade books, travel and nature guides, and more. </div></li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../archSpec/base/ditamarkup.html">DITA markup</a></strong><div class="desc">Topics and maps are the basic building blocks of the Darwin Information Typing   Architecture (DITA). Metadata attributes and values can be added to DITA topics and maps, as well   as to elements within topics, to allow for conditional publishing and content reuse. </div></li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../archSpec/base/ditaaddressing.html">DITA addressing</a></strong><div class="desc"><span class="ph">DITA provides two           addressing mechanisms. DITA addresses either are direct URI-based addresses, or they are           indirect key-based addresses. Within DITA documents, individual elements are addressed by           unique identifiers specified on the <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@id</code> attribute. DITA defines two           fragment-identifier syntaxes; one is the full fragment-identifier syntax, and the other is           an abbreviated fragment-identifier syntax that can be used when addressing non-topic           elements from within the same topic.</span></div></li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../archSpec/base/behaviors.html">DITA processing</a></strong><div class="desc">DITA processing is affected by a number of factors, including         attributes that indicate the set of vocabulary and constraint modules on which a DITA         document depends; navigation; linking; content reuse (using direct or indirect addressing);         conditional processing; branch filtering; chunking; and more. In addition, translation of         DITA content is expedited through the use of the <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@dir</code>,             <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@translate</code>, and <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@xml:lang</code> attributes, and the             <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;index-sort-as&gt;</code> element.</div></li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../archSpec/base/configuration-specialization-and-constraints.html">Configuration, specialization, generalization, and constraints</a></strong><div class="desc">The extension facilities of DITA allow existing vocabulary and     constraint modules to be combined to create specific DITA document types. Vocabulary modules     also can be specialized to meet requirements that are not satisfied by existing markup. </div></li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../archSpec/base/coding-requirements.html">Coding practices for DITA grammar files</a></strong><div class="desc">This section collects all of the rules for creating modular DTD, RELAX NG, or XML Schema   grammar files to represent DITA document types, specializations, and constraints.</div></li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../archSpec/technicalContent/technical-content-specializations.html">Technical content specializations</a></strong><div class="desc">This section contains information about the technical content specializations.
