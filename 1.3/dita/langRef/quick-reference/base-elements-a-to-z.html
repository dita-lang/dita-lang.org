The bodydiv element is specifically designed to be a grouping element, without any explicit semantics, other than to organize subsets of content into logical groups that are not intended or should not be contained as a topic. As such, it does not contain an explicit title to avoid enabling the creation of deeply nested content that would otherwise be written as separate topics. For content that requires a title, use a section element or a nested topic.">bodydiv</a></li>

For example, a product might be made up of many components, each of which is installable separately. Components might also be shared by several products so that the same component is available for installation with many products. An implementation might use this identification to check cross-component dependencies when some components are installed, but not others. An implementation might use the identification to make sure that topics are hidden, removed, or flagged in some way when the component they describe isn't installed.">component</a></li>

<li class="sli"><a class="xref" href="../base/data.html" title="The data element represents a property within a DITA topic or map. While the data element can be used directly to capture properties, it is particularly useful as a basis for specialization. Default processing should treat the content as an unknown kind of metadata and ignore it for rendering, but custom processing might match the name attribute or specialized element and use the element for automated manipulation or to format data associated with the body flow. For example, a specialized data element might be used to format properties as sidebars or other adornments or to harvest properties for automated processing.">data</a></li>
